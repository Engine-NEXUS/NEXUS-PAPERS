---

## Phase 5: UI Overhaul + Installer + Sidebar (PR #16)

### OpenClaw Removal
User requested permanent removal of OpenClaw from the laptop:
> "i want u to permanlty delete the open claw from my laptop"

Removed:
- Global npm package `openclaw@2026.6.1`
- npm shims under `%APPDATA%\npm\`
- `%USERPROFILE%\.openclaw\`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\openclaw\`
- Verified no autostart entries

### White Theme UI Overhaul (`5ee9275`)
User requested a white interface:
> "now that u have all the env lets create an interface for that lets start building one i want it white interface"

Built:
1. **Framer Motion** dependency added (^12.43.0)
2. **CSS Design Tokens** (`tokens.css`) — colors, shadows, spacing, radii, typography
3. **Main orb window** expanded from 200x200 to 320x440 with white card, status bar, transcript panel
4. **Settings window** (NEW, 600x720) — 5 tabs: General, Audio, Wake Word, Privacy, Backend
5. **Setup wizard** redesigned as 4-step onboarding (Welcome → Server → Voice → Accounts)
6. **Rust IPC commands** for settings (get/set, test mic, test speaker)
7. **Tray menu** updated to open settings window

Test results:
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- cargo check: 0 errors (9 pre-existing warnings)
- Release build: 4m 07s
- NEXUS launches, sidecar healthy
- RAM: ~50 MB (nexus) + ~65 MB (sidecar)

### Orb Revert (`4e1086c`)
User was upset that the orb was modified:
> "why did u create that bring the orginal self back i said for the installer interface when a user instal exe for steup create the ineterface bring my orl aniamtion bac i dont want any chnage to be made in that"

Reverted:
- Main window: 320x440 → 200x200
- Avatar: 120px → 180px
- States: 6 → 4 (idle/listening/thinking/speaking)
- White card → removed
- StatusBar.tsx → deleted
- TranscriptPanel.tsx → deleted

Kept:
- Settings window (600x720, tabbed, white theme)
- Setup wizard (4-step, white theme)
- CSS design tokens
- Framer Motion dependency
- Settings IPC commands

**Key lesson:** The orb is sacred. Never modify it without explicit user request.

### NSIS Installer Research
User clarified they wanted an **installer interface** — the screen shown when installing the .exe:
> "i said for the installer interface when a user instal exe for steup create the ineterface"

Research performed:
- Tauri v2 NSIS customization options
- Custom NSIS template (Handlebars syntax)
- Header image (150x57 BMP) and sidebar image (164x314 BMP)
- Installer hooks (.nsh files)
- White background via `SetCtlColors`
- All Handlebars variables in the template

### White-Themed NSIS Installer (`6663e57`)
Built:
1. **Custom NSIS template** (`nexus-installer.nsi`) — downloaded default, customized with white background
2. **Sidebar image** (`sidebar.bmp`) — 164x314 with gradient orb, "NEXUS" text, feature list
3. **Header image** (`header.bmp`) — 150x57 with "NEXUS" gradient text
4. **Tauri config** — template, headerImage, sidebarImage, installerIcon, lzma compression
5. **Setup wizard** — rewritten with white theme, 4 steps

Build output: `NEXUS_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (40.1 MB)

### NEXUS Uninstalled from Laptop
User requested complete removal to start fresh:
> "delete NEXUS from Program Files"

NEXUS was installed at `C:\Users\Chitkul Lakshya\AppData\Local\NEXUS` (currentUser install).
Completely removed:
- Install directory
- Registry key (HKCU\...\Uninstall\NEXUS)
- Start Menu shortcuts
- Desktop shortcuts
- Scheduled task
- App data
All verified gone.

### Desktop Shortcut Removal + Bigger Installer + Multi-Option Accounts (`03a34ad`)
User requested:
> "removing the desktop shortcut option from the installer"
> "make the interface bigger"
> "add account adding and GitHub connecting multi-option"

Built:
1. **Removed desktop shortcut** from NSIS installer
   - Removed `MUI_FINISHPAGE_SHOWREADME` defines
   - Removed `CreateOrUpdateDesktopShortcut` function
   - Removed passive/silent mode desktop shortcut creation
   - Uninstaller still cleans up old desktop shortcuts

2. **Bigger installer images**
   - Sidebar: 164x314 → 220x500 (NSIS auto-sizes window to sidebar)
   - Header: 150x57 → 180x68
   - Generated with PowerShell + System.Drawing

3. **Multi-option account cards** in setup wizard
   - Google card with Google logo SVG icon (48x48 white container)
   - GitHub card with GitHub logo SVG icon (48x48 dark container)
   - Connect/Disconnect/Not configured states
   - Larger provider cards with brand icons

### Right-Side Response Sidebar (`03a34ad`)
User requested a sidebar that shows only for server responses:
> "i want to create another br at the right side of the screen that will should the response from the server it will only show if the request went to the server or n8n automation engine only or else it should be the same normally"

Built:
1. **New Tauri window** (`sidebar`) — 280x500, transparent, bottom-right, alwaysOnTop
2. **Frontend** (`src/sidebar/`) — SidebarApp, sidebarStore, sidebar.css, main.tsx
3. **Communication** via Tauri events:
   - `sidebar:show` { query } — emitted when sendTranscript() succeeds
   - `sidebar:response` { text } — emitted when server sends result
   - `sidebar:hide` — emitted when server sends done/error
4. **Rust IPC** — `show_sidebar` (positions at bottom-right), `hide_sidebar`
5. **Integration** in `wsBridge.ts` — emit sidebar events at the right points

Key design decisions:
- Only shows for server requests (n8n/Ollama/Hermes), NOT for local commands
- Slides in from right edge with bouncy spring animation
- Shows "Thinking..." with animated dots while waiting
- Shows response text when server responds
- Auto-scrolls for long responses
- Slides back out after response is spoken
- `alwaysOnTop: true` — visible above other windows
- `skipTaskbar: true` — doesn't clutter taskbar
- `focus: false` — doesn't steal focus

Test results:
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- cargo check: 0 errors
- Release build: 3m 54s
- NEXUS launches: 49.5 MB RAM (well under 200 MB target)
- Sidecar healthy

## Key User Feedback Moments

### 1. "bring my orl aniamtion bac"
The orb was modified without the user wanting it. The user's orb (200x200 Lottie animation with smile/loading segments) is sacred and must never be changed without explicit request. This led to commit `4e1086c` (revert).

### 2. "i said for the installer interface"
The user wanted an installer interface (NSIS .exe installer screen), not changes to the orb. This clarified that "interface" can mean different things — always ask which interface.

### 3. "dont push until i say so"
The user wanted control over when code is pushed to GitHub. Nothing was pushed until the user explicitly said "push to the github with a pr and merge the pr".

### 4. "dont squesh in the merge"
The user wanted all commits preserved in the merge, not squashed. PR #16 was merged with a fast-forward merge preserving all 8 commits.

### 5. "sidebar should only be shown if the response came from the server"
The user wanted the response sidebar to only appear for server requests (n8n/Ollama), not for local commands. This drove the design decision to trigger the sidebar on `sendTranscript()` success only.

## Current Architecture Summary

### Windows (4 Tauri windows)
| Window | Size | Position | Purpose |
|--------|------|----------|---------|
| `main` | 200x200 | Bottom-center | Orb animation (Lottie smile/loading) |
| `setup` | 520x680 | Center | First-launch setup wizard (4 steps) |
| `settings` | 600x720 | Center | Tabbed settings (General, Audio, Wake, Privacy, Backend) |
| `sidebar` | 280x500 | Bottom-right | Server response panel (only for n8n/Ollama) |

### Processes
| Process | RAM | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| `nexus.exe` | ~50 MB | Tauri main app (Rust + WebView2) |
| `pythonw.exe` | ~64 MB | Python FastAPI sidecar (STT, session management) |
| **Total** | **~114 MB** | Well under 200 MB target |

### Audio Pipeline (All Local)
```
Mic → ScriptProcessorNode → Float32 buffer → Silero VAD
  → silence detected → downsample to 16kHz → faster-whisper STT (localhost:8000)
  → transcript text → sendTranscript() to remote server
  → server responds with text → Web Speech API TTS speaks it locally
```

### Trigger Paths
1. **Hotkey** (Ctrl+Shift+Space) → `__NEXUS_WAKE__()` → `wakeWithGreeting()` → `startListening()`
2. **Wake word** (openWakeWord KWS) → Rust emits wake event → `win.eval("__NEXUS_WAKE__()")`
3. **Tier 3 command** (acoustic classifier) → `command-detected` event → direct execution (no STT)

### Response Paths
1. **Server response** (n8n/Ollama) → sidebar shows + orb shows + TTS speaks
2. **Local command** (open app, search) → orb shows + TTS speaks "Ok sir" + no sidebar
3. **Tier 3 command** (acoustic) → orb shows + TTS speaks "Ok sir" + no sidebar
